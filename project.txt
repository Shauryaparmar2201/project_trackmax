Creating a task tracker project in Python can be a great way to practice your programming skills. Here's a simplified outline to get you started on a command-line task tracker project:

*Project Name*: Simple Task Tracker

*Project Description*: This Python program will allow users to manage and track their tasks. Users can add tasks, view their tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.

*Features*:
1. Add a Task: Users can add a new task with a title and description.
2. View Tasks: Users can view a list of all their tasks.
3. Mark Task as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed.
4. Delete Task: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.
5. Save and Load: Implement the ability to save tasks to a file and load them when the program starts.

*Step-by-Step Implementation*:

1. *Create a Task Class*: Define a Python class to represent a task. It should have attributes like title, description, and a completion status.

2. *Create a Task Manager Class*: Implement a class to manage tasks. This class should have methods for adding, viewing, marking as completed, and deleting tasks. It should also handle saving and loading tasks from a file.

3. *User Interface*: Create a simple command-line interface that allows users to interact with the Task Manager. Use a loop to continuously prompt the user for actions (e.g., add, view, mark, delete) until they choose to exit.

4. *Data Storage*: Implement methods for saving and loading tasks to/from a file. You can use a text file or a simple database (SQLite) for this purpose.

5. *Testing*: Test your program thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. Make sure to handle errors gracefully, like when the user tries to mark a task that doesn't exist.

6. *Documentation*: Add comments and documentation to your code to make it easy for others (or yourself) to understand how it works.

7. *User Instructions*: Provide clear instructions for users on how to use your program.

8. *Extras*: You can enhance your project by adding features like due dates for tasks, priority levels, and the ability to sort tasks based on different criteria.

Remember to break down each feature into smaller steps and tackle them one by one. This will make it easier to build your task tracker project incrementally. Good luck!
